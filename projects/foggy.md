### July 25

A lot of getting to know SpriteKit particles and SKFieldNodes. Setting strange regions with constructive set geometry seems to work very well. Am hoping for more Swift-specific illumination to share in future updates -- although I will say not having .h and .m files vying for pixels on my 13" mpb is an insufficiently sung feature.
