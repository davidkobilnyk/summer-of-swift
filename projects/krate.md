# Krate - Create and Destroy

## Description

Krate is a fresh twist on gem puzzle games, featuring a spinning board; creeping evil, powerful combos and tough choices.  Most of all, my goal is that Krate will entertain and reward players.

This is my summer Swift learning project, born through the fortuitous coincidence of the Swift announcement with the Spring semesterâ€™s end.

## Updates

### July 8th
Basic gameplay mechanics implemented with colorful blocks!

### July 10
Krate saw terrific advancement this week!  [I wrote a summary of work here.](http://www.thinkingswiftly.com/krate-advancing-leaps-bounds/)

**Quick updates list:**
- Placeholder graphics
- Sound management system (with some placeholders)
- I created a [Backbone.js style events manager for Swift](https://github.com/StephenHaney/Swift-Custom-Events) (Please check it out and help make it better!)
- Added many new game mechanics

It'll be hard to match this pace in the future, but I'm happy with what was accomplished.

### July 25
More steady progress on Krate over the past two weeks.  [I wrote a blog post about increasing 'skill cap'](http://www.thinkingswiftly.com/raising-skill-cap-hinting-upcoming-events/) and some of the things I'm working on in Krate to do just that.

**[Here's a video of the new HUD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQIhELP75Ys)** which lets players see their upcoming color choices.

Also, started work on the point system!  Work was pretty full, so I'm hoping to have more time in August to push forward.

### August 10
I was able to dive in the last few days and implement levels (so the game increases in tempo and difficulty) very much like Tetris.  Also, big combos now clear out one "dead" tile.  Plus a variety of other mechanical changes.  Visually, the game looks very much like last update so I'll skip another video for this round.

The great news is all of my basic game systems are in place and my mechanics are very close to being complete.  I hope to have the gameplay finished and locked in by the August 25th update.  I'll use the final month to find an artist and implement all the extras like menus and leaderboards.
