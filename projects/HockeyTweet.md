# HockeyTweet

## Description

Originally written in 2009 as a way to teach myself iOS programming I thought what better way to learn Swift than to dust off this old app and rewrite it in Swift. I don't expect to rerelease the app again since I think the Twitter app landscape, autocompletion, and predictive text have changed so much since the app was first released.
