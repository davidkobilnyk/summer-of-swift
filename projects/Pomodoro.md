# <PROJECT NAME>

## Description

Pomodoro is an IOS application designed to allow users to easily use the “Pomodoro” time management technique throughout their work day.  The user of this application will be able to set a “Time Interval” which is the length of each chunk of work time throughout the day.  The application will cycle between work and break time.  The user will also set a specified amount of time that he or she wishes to make each break period.

An example of this workflow would be a person selecting a work time interval of 24 minutes and a break time interval of 6 minutes.  Throughout the entire day, the user will work for 24 minutes and then immediately transition to a break for 6 minutes and back to a work period for 24 minutes and so on.

This application will include 3 main tabs - “Timer”, “Trends”, and “Settings”.  Detailed below is a description of what each tab will display.

Timer - This is the primary page of the application.  The user will spend the most time in this view.  In this view, the user will be able to see a visual display and timer of their current Pomodoro cycle and the amount of time left on the cycle.  The time, day and date will also be displayed here.  When using the application while working, a user will leave their phone turned on, on this screen.

Trends - Trends will display the users overall work habits.  Trends displayed will include things such as:

- The total amount of time worked
- Total amount of break time 
- Average time worked each day 
- The average break time each day 
- The most productive day of the week and month 
- Most productive time period of the day 
- How often the user is using the application
- How often the user is meeting daily and weekly work goals

Settings - Settings will present the user will a number of settings, customizations and other preferences that tailor the user experience to best fit each individual user.  Settings options will include things such as:

- Specified time interval
- Daily Goal (min worked)
- Weekly Goal (hours worked)
- Sound on/off (The application will have the ability to play a short sound when an interval is completed)
- Style (A white “Day” and black “Night” mode will be provided to best suit the user’s work environment)
- Clock Style - Standard or Military
- Add additional cycles to app (For example, a user might want to work for 24 minutes, take a break for 6 minutes and go for a walk every 2 hours for 15 minutes).

## Updates


### July 10

Project was setup, Github repository was created and empty project was pushed to Github.

### July 25

During the past 2 weeks or so, I have continued studying Swift via reading Apples iBook and playing around with code in playgrounds.  I have setup the basic layout of the Pomodoro Application (3 tab views) but have not yet added any code.  In an effort to make this project more public, I have written a first blog post detailing the project on my website.  This can be viewed at www.hammondbrad.com/blog

### August 10

Not much has changed during the time between this weeks update and the last update.  I have learned much more about Swift and have began to do some research on how to build the main timer functionality within my application.  I am very new to programming and as is said very often with anything "the more that you learn, the more you realize how much you don't know".  I feel that this quote is a good representation of the stage that I am at curently.  I know a lot about Swift and think that it is a very neat language but am trying to grasp how to apply apply the principles learned in the Swift book and create an actual IOS application.
