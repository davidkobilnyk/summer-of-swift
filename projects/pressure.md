### July 10

I checked out [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24397927/where-to-find-information-on-ios-8-variable-touch-sizing-api) Stack Overflow answer on the touch pressure implementation and started playing around with the code in a Playground. I also mocked up a couple of ideas for how buttons could respond to pressure.

### July 25

We now have a basic prototype working that prints out the majorRadius of the touch event.
