## Updates

### July 12

Attended the SLUG Swift class + Hackday in San Francisco on July 12. A good introduction to Swift. My team built a sort of flappy bird clone with doge, called [Hoppy Doge](http://github.com/dunphyben/gamerunner). 

A fellow hacker, Evan Ku, presented a cool To-Do app using core data. This really piqued my interest and I thought it might be useful to the development of Super To-Do. Evan was kind enough to offer me his code for study. I will be reviewing it for my next update.
