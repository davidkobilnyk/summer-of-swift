### July 14

Completed a basic analog clock with ability to set hour and minute by touching and dragging the hour and minute hands.

Gained a bit more skill with core graphics usage.<br/>
Used operator overloading to add/multiply numbers with CGPoint.<br/>
Created and implemented a custom delegate.

Enjoyed the math for determining where the hand should be drawn and which hour or minute was selected based on touch position.<br/>
Had some issues with number types -- seems like I had to typecast to CGFloat ridiculously frequently to avoid errors like "'NSNumber' is not a subtype of 'UInt8'" (even when there wasn't a UInt8 present).
